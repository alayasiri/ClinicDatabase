<h1>Building a Database for a Clinic</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>

Developing a database management system for Noble Health Clinic, which does not have an online system to track its patients, staff, and appointments. 

The need for this system stems from the inefficiency and inaccuracy caused by the absence of an online system. Without an online system, all record-keeping has to be done manually, on paper, or using a file-based system. This increases the chances of human error, redundancy, security compromises, slow report retrieval, expensive operating costs, backlogged patient schedules, causing a loss in revenue, lack of compatibility with other applications allowing patients to access their information, limit scalibility, and is an overall inconvenience for customers and staff. The DBMS will be used by the clinic to schedule appointments, update patients' medical charts, track labs and prescriptions, and store billing information.
